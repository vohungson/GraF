# GraF
The project of Master M1 in Bordeaux University, France
The GL project of MINF18 here is a set of requests for the project :

1- create a gitHub project with name GraF (for Graph Framework). My login in gitHub is baudon (for the invitation) and the associated adress olivier.baudon@labri.fr Please tell me each time you want that I take a look on your code.

2- Provide an interface which allow to create graphs where a vertex is represented by a circle and an edge by a straight line.

3- Give the possibility to move vertices.

4- Give the possibility to change the form of the vertices and the edges (arc, or segments with intermediate points movable by the user), and to have oriented edges.

5- Give the possibility to suppress a vertex or an edge.

6- Add labels to vertices and edges.

7- Give the possibility to the user to change the position of the labels, and the value of the labels.

Remark : I propose that you provide a toolbar on the left side of the window to propose the different types of vertices and edges and to change the effect of a click (for example, an icon with scissors (or death's head) means supress, an icon with a cross means add an intermediate point to an edge, ...)

For each version, you may also provide the tkz version of the drawing, using a menu for the export.
